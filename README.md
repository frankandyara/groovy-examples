#Groovy Examples

Some simple Groovy examples to show how fun and easy Groovy can be 
and hopefully provide some useful utilities and scripts.

Potential ideas:
- Display how expressive looping can be (times, each, etc)
- How to read from and write to a file
- Scan a webpage for specific content
- REST calls

*Placeholder for Instructions/Links on how to get Groovy on your system.*

Thank you,
